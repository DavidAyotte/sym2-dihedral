# Sym2-Dihedral

This repo contains multiple functions written in PARI/GP about modulars forms, Bernoulli numbers and L-functions. More precisely, on the trace of the symmetric-square L-function and dihedral congruences of modular forms. This code was written as part of my master thesis.

## Files

* `trace.gp`: functions about the trace of the Symmetric square L-function as defined by Dummigan and Heim
* `dihedral.gp`: functions about dihedral congruences on modular forms
* `misc.gp`: miscellaneous functions about p-valuation of Bernoulli numbers and modular forms

In a gp session, after reading a file, you can type `? name_of_file` to obtain more information about the file.
